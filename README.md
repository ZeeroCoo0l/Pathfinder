# PathFinder Map Application
I developed PathFinder as part of my school project to deepen my understanding of graph theory and its practical applications. 
This application allowed me to experiment with graphs in a geographical context by placing custom positions on a map of Europe and creating connections between them.

## Overview
This image shows a geographical mapping application called "PathFinder" displaying a map of Europe with a specific connection plotted between two locations.
